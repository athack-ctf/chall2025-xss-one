# Running Your Challenge

Place all the code needed to run your challenge in this directory, and document the required environment as described
below:

- If you have included a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml`, then that is all that should be enough (unless additional
  explanations are needed as well).
- If you have not, please document the steps to create a runnable instance of your challenge, as we (Anis and Hugo)
  will refer to this when adding the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- For any clarifications, consult us (Anis and Hugo).
