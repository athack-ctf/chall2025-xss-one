# FLAGS

- `ATHACKCTF{y0ur1stflagGoesHere}` 
- `ATHACKCTF{y0ur2ndflagGoesHere}`
- `...`

## IMPORTANT
Unless it's impossible or technically difficult, flags should follow the format `ATHACKCTF{__________}` 
(as shown in the examples above). The random value within the brackets should be sufficiently long and non-trivial.
