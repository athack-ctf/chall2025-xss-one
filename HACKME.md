The description of your challenge as seen by participants in CTFd. Try to make it feel within the theme
of the event...

---
If your challenge is a multi-flag one (i.e., it consists of a sequence of sub-challenges each rewarded with
its own flag), requiring a different description for each sub-challenge, then have your descriptions split as 
done with this paragraph, and the next one.

---
Obviously, for each sub-challenge, you should provide its flag value in [solution/FLAGS.md](solution/FLAGS.md).
